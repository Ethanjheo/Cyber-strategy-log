## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This repository documents my structured, long-term execution plan to become a cybersecurity strategist specializing in Operational Technology (OT), ICS/SCADA environments, and industrial cyber architecture. It blends policy, risk management, and technical understanding into a daily log of progress and refinement.

## ðŸ§  Methodology

- UWA Cybersecurity Major with OT-oriented focus
- Daily logs of hands-on practice (e.g. TryHackMe, lab-based exercises)
- Weekly review and adjustment based on GPT-driven feedback
- Continuous improvement guided by personal analytics and journaling history (7+ years)

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

- `daily-log/` â€” summarized records of each dayâ€™s work
- `tryhackme/` â€” walkthroughs, terminology, and screenshots
- `reflections/` â€” key lessons, failures, and pivots
- `resources/` â€” curated tools, articles, and frameworks
- `essays/` â€” writing exercises on cybersecurity/global issues

## âœ¨ Vision

To build a strategic mindset grounded in real-world OT/ICS security needsâ€”capable of designing secure systems, writing policy, managing risk, and communicating across disciplines. This is not just a study log, but the architecture of a life defined by logic, intent, and discipline.
