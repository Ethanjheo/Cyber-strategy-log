## Summary of Key Concepts

### 1. Access Control  
- Authentication: Verifying user identity (e.g., password, biometrics)  
- Authorization: Granting permission based on role  
- Key principles: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Least Privilege Principle  

### 2. Incident Response (Based on NIST Framework)  
1. Preparation  
2. Detection  
3. Containment  
4. Eradication  
5. Recovery  
6. Lessons Learned  

### 3. Forensics  
- Preserve original data (analyze only copies)  
- Maintain integrity and legal chain of custody  
- Use logs, memory dumps, and system snapshots as evidence  

### 4. Compliance  
- Follow industry/legal frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)  
- Document all policies, standards, and procedures  
- Auditable records are essential: "If it's not documented, it didn't happen"

## My Thoughts  
Security is not about preventing incidents, but about designing systems that do not collapse when they happen.  
Anticipating incident scenarios, minimizing organizational damage, assigning responsibility, reducing legal risks, and ensuring post-incident learning must all be considered in advance.  
Security is a structural responsibility embedded in governance, not merely a technical issue.
