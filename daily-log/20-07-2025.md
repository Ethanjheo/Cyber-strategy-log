##  Personal Reflection

Understanding technology is important,  
but understanding **security policies, standards, and how to respond accordingly** is just as crucial.  
Security isn't just about tools—it's about following rules and frameworks during real incidents.  
This perspective shifts cybersecurity from a technical task to a strategic discipline.
