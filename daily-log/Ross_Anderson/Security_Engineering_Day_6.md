## My Reflection
Compliance is ultimately a managerial choice. While it may appear as a short-term cost, in the long run it becomes an asset that strengthens organizational stability and trust. By adhering to regulations, a company signals predictable behavior within the formal system, which provides customers and investors with confidence.

Compliance also reduces risk. Operating within regulatory frameworks connects organizations with governments and broader stakeholders, enabling risk-sharing and increasing the likelihood of cooperative solutions.

Thus, compliance should not be viewed merely as an obligation but as a strategic decision that creates long-term value.
