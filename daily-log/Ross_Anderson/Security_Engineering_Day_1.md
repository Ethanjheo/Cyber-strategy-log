## 1. Core Distinctions
- **Safety vs Security**  
  - *Safety:* Protection against accidents or natural failures.  
  - *Security:* Protection against intentional, intelligent adversaries.  
- **Key Implication:** Security must anticipate adaptive opponents, not just random failure.  

---

## 2. The Security Model
- **Trust:** The baseline assumptions that systems depend on.  
- **Threats:** Potential actors and conditions that may cause harm.  
- **Attacks:** Realization of threats exploiting vulnerabilities.  
- **Defenses:** Countermeasures designed to prevent or mitigate attacks.

## 3. Socio-Technical Perspective
- Security is not purely technical; it is embedded in society.  
- Effective security requires:  
  - Legal frameworks  
  - Institutional enforcement  
  - Cultural norms  
  - Technical safeguards  

---

## 4. Lessons from Practice
- **Human Factor:** Most failures trace back to mistakes, negligence, or insiders.  
- **Risk Management:**  
  - Formula: *Risk = Probability × Impact*  
  - Used to prioritize defense resources.  
- **Policy Gap:** Poorly designed regulations can generate secondary risks.  

---

## 5. Critical Insight
- Security is not a static state but an ongoing negotiation of trust.  
- It is best understood as a **scenario-driven discipline**, preparing for plausible failures before they occur.  
- Without considering law, economics, and human behavior, purely technical controls remain fragile.

## My Reflection
Security is not merely about protection but fundamentally about defending systems against external threats. However, with technological progress, insider mistakes and negligence have emerged as major causes of incidents. Thus, security must encompass both external and internal factors.

Risk management becomes central: risk is calculated as the probability of occurrence multiplied by the potential damage. Security regulations must prioritize threats accordingly. Yet, if such regulations are designed without regard to the broader context of law, culture, and institutions, they may cause unintended secondary harms.

Equally, the psychological and behavioral dimensions of individuals cannot be overlooked. Historically, many security failures originated less from technical flaws and more from human mistakes or negligence. Therefore, effective security must combine technical defenses with education, policies, and institutional safeguards.

In essence, security is not a purely technical matter but a complex socio-political and economic issue. Only by reflecting this context can security measures gain both legitimacy and effectiveness.
