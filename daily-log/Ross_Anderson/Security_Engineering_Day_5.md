## 1. Core Concepts (Risk Management)

### Risk Identification  
- Organizations must identify threats, vulnerabilities, and critical assets.  
- Example: Detecting insider threats or outdated software.  

### Risk Assessment  
- Evaluating risks by analyzing likelihood and impact.  
- **Formula:** Risk = Likelihood × Impact  
- Example: A DDoS attack may be low likelihood but very high impact.  

### Risk Response  
- Four common strategies:  
  - **Avoidance:** Eliminate the risky activity.  
  - **Transfer:** Shift risk via insurance or outsourcing.  
  - **Mitigation:** Reduce risk with safeguards (e.g., firewalls, monitoring).  
  - **Acceptance:** Accept residual risk when controls are not cost-effective.  

### Risk Monitoring & Review  
- Risks evolve over time, so continuous monitoring and reassessment are essential.

## 2. Real-World Applications
- **Banking:** Fraud detection and operational risk modeling.  
- **Energy Industry:** Strengthening resilience against supply chain and OT attacks.  
- **Cloud Services:** Automated monitoring to manage availability risks.  
- **Compliance Audits:** Applying ISO 31000, NIST SP 800-30, and enterprise risk registers.

## 3. Key Takeaways
- Risk cannot be eliminated, only managed.  
- Prioritization is essential—focus on the most critical risks.  
- Governance and compliance frameworks help standardize risk management.

## My Reflection
From a pragmatic perspective, risk management is essentially about reducing exposure within an established structure. Just as violating explicit legal provisions constitutes illegality, while exploiting what lies outside of them becomes a loophole, risks are also framed and governed by institutional and organizational boundaries.

Risk is easier to manage when treated as a set of scenarios with defined variables. Expanding the number of considered scenarios can provide more options for response, but it also increases management costs; therefore, the ability to prioritize becomes critical.

Within organizations, leaders must know how to employ both avoidance and transfer effectively. Beyond this, maximizing the ROI of security risk management is also a core responsibility of security executives. For this reason, security should not be confined to technical measures alone, but should also be closely integrated into corporate governance and strategic decision-making.
