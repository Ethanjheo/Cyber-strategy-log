## 1. Core Concepts (Distributed Systems)  
- **Definition:** A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to users as a single coherent system.  
- **Purpose:**  
  1. **Reliability** – the system keeps working even if parts fail.  
  2. **Consistency** – data remains accurate across different nodes.  
  3. **Scalability** – services can expand to handle more users.  
- **Analogy:** A distributed system is like a **team of messengers** carrying the same royal decree across the kingdom—if they disagree, chaos results; if they coordinate, order is preserved.

## 2. Real-World Applications  
- **Financial Transactions:** Ensuring concurrency control so that double-spending or inconsistent balances do not occur.  
- **Energy & OT Systems:** Maintaining fault tolerance in power grid control, where failures could disrupt national infrastructure.  
- **Cloud Services:** Handling naming and identity management for millions of users and virtual machines.  
- **Cybersecurity Operations:** Detecting and mitigating DoS attacks that exploit distributed vulnerabilities.

## 3. Key Takeaways  
- Distributed systems face unique threats: **Concurrency conflicts, Byzantine failures, DoS attacks, naming confusion**.  
- Building **fault tolerance and resilience** is not just technical—it is a matter of **governance and risk management**.  
- In GRC terms:  
  - **Governance:** Establish rules for data sharing and identity.  
  - **Risk:** Plan for failures, attacks, and inconsistencies.  
  - **Compliance:** Ensure systems meet reliability and security standards (ISO/IEC 27001, IEC 62443).

## My Reflection
The primary role of distributed systems is to **distribute risk**, not to impose unnecessary complexity. Since achieving 100% faultlessness is impossible, security must also be established through **governance-based defense**.  

This means that protection cannot rely solely on technical controls but must include **managerial security measures** as well. Governance sets the framework in which risks are segmented and managed, allowing failures in one part of the system to be contained rather than spreading throughout.  

In practice, this reflects the idea that distributed security is a matter of **policy and structure as much as technology**. By acknowledging the limits of perfection, organizations can design layered defenses and treat governance as a proactive shield, ensuring that distributed systems remain both resilient and trustworthy.
