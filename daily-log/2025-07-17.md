## CH15: Understanding Network Connectivity Devices

### Summary
- **Hub**: Sends data to all devices (비효율, 비보안적)
- **Switch**: Sends data only to intended device using **MAC address** (더 빠르고 보안적)
- **Router**: Connects networks, uses **IP address** (인터넷 연결)
- **Gateway**: Converts protocols between different networks (프로토콜 번역기)
- **Bridge**: Connects similar networks, filters traffic (스위치가 대체)
- **Modem**: Converts digital ↔ analog (전화선 기반 인터넷)
- **Access Point (AP)**: Enables wireless connection to wired LAN (Wi-Fi 제공)

## Mini Essay: Architecture in Connectivity

> Secure systems are not built on code alone.  
> They depend on how devices communicate—quietly, efficiently, and with purpose.  
>  
> A **hub** shouts to everyone, while a **switch** whispers to one. A **router** maps the journey; a **gateway** translates the dialect. **Access points** invite wireless guests; **modems** bridge the digital and analog worlds.  
>  
> Understanding connectivity isn't about naming devices—it's about recognizing **why** and **how** each piece shapes the system. That’s the shift from technician to strategist.

- **IP address** (인터넷 주소): Logical network identifier
- **Protocol** (통신 규약): Rules for data exchange
- **Access Point** (무선 접속점): Wi-Fi 제공 장비
- **Gateway** (게이트웨이): 프로토콜 변환 장치

## Reflection
CH15는 네트워크 구조의 기본기를 알려주는 챕터. 암기보단, 기기의 '의도'를 이해하며 읽었음. 
Rather than focusing on memorization, I read with the intention of understanding the purpose behind each device.
