## Key Concepts

### 1. Human Risk in Security

- Most security incidents involve user mistakes.
- Common threats: phishing, password reuse, unauthorized devices.
- Attackers prefer to exploit people over systems.

### 2. Security Awareness Program

Effective programs should be:

- **Continuous**: Regular training, not just one-time.
- **Role-Based**: Customized content per job function.
- **Engaging**: Practical, interactive, and relevant.

Includes simulations (e.g., phishing tests), real-world examples, and repetition to reinforce behavior.

### 3. Policy Enforcement

Security policies must be:

- **Technically enforced**: automated controls like password rules, USB blocking.
- **Administratively supported**: mandatory training, HR enforcement.
- **Culturally embedded**: leadership buy-in, normalization of secure behavior.
