## 1. Study Notes
- Learned the purpose of security frameworks (NIST, ISO/IEC 27001) and how they guide organizations in risk management and compliance.  
- Frameworks vary by region but share common goals: protecting information assets, ensuring continuity, and meeting regulatory demands.  
- Frameworks are not rigid checklists but strategic tools that align legal, technical, and operational practices.

## 2. Global Framework Comparison

| Region        | Framework                       | Purpose                                                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| USA           | NIST Cybersecurity Framework     | Risk-based framework for critical infrastructure and industry   |
| EU            | ISO/IEC 27001                    | International ISMS standard adopted by most industries          |
| South Korea   | K-ISMS                           | Government-backed ISMS certification system                     |
| Australia     | ACSC Essential Eight, ISM        | Mitigation strategies for organizations; supports risk-based security posture |
| Global        | ISO/IEC 27000 Series             | Information security governance, lifecycle, and standardization |

## 3. My Reflection
Frameworks act as both **legal and operational shields** for organizations.  
Companies should assess their business environment, regulatory exposure, and infrastructure maturity before selecting a framework.  

> Frameworks are essential for managing risk, proving due diligence, and securing long-term resilience.  
> In the case of Australia, ACSC’s “Essential Eight” reflects a practical, prioritized defense approach—simple but impactful.
