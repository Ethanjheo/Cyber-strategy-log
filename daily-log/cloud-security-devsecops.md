# GRC Week 1, Day 3 – Cloud Security & DevSecOps
**Book**: *Cybersecurity Essentials* by Charles J. Brooks

**Week 1 – Day 3** (GRC 7-Day Study Plan)

##  Summary

Today’s focus was on cloud security models (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and how DevSecOps transforms the security approach in modern systems.

- **Cloud Models**:
  - **SaaS**: Minimal user responsibility; provider handles most layers.
  - **PaaS**: Shared responsibility; user manages app-level security.
  - **IaaS**: Maximum user responsibility; infrastructure-level control needed.
  
- **DevSecOps**:
  - Security is integrated from the **start** of the development process.
  - The concept of "**Shift Left**" means vulnerabilities are addressed earlier, not just after deployment.

- **Shared Responsibility**:
  - In cloud environments, **security is not solely the provider’s duty**.
  - Both the **service provider and user** must uphold their parts of cloud security.

##  My Insight

Different users and organizations require different levels of service.  
Cloud service models are categorized into **SaaS**, **PaaS**, and **IaaS**, depending on the desired control and responsibility.  

**DevSecOps** introduced a **"Shift Left"** approach, pushing security concerns to the beginning of development rather than the end.  
Additionally, **cloud security is no longer solely a vendor’s responsibility**—it is a **shared model** requiring mutual accountability.
