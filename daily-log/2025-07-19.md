## Key Cybersecurity Concepts (CH1–5 Review)

### CIA Triad  
- **Confidentiality** – Only authorized users can access data  
- **Integrity** – Data remains accurate and unaltered  
- **Availability** – Systems/data accessible when needed  

### Ransomware  
- Encrypts files and demands payment (usually cryptocurrency)  
- Threatens to destroy or leak data if unpaid  

### Social Engineering  
- Psychological manipulation to steal info or access  
- Examples:  
  - Phishing  
  - Tailgating  
  - Pretexting  

### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption  
- **Symmetric**:  
  - 🔐 Same key for encryption/decryption  
  - ✅ Fast  
  - ❌ Risky if key is exposed  
- **Asymmetric**:  
  - 🔐 Public key encrypts, private key decrypts  
  - ✅ Safer for communication  
  - ❌ Slower  

### Data Packets  
- Data is **split into packets** to be efficiently transferred  
- Each packet contains data + **routing & order info**

## Vocabulary of the Day  

| Word         | Meaning                                               | Example Sentence                                            |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **prey on**  | exploit or target the weak/vulnerable                 | Hackers prey on emotionally vulnerable users.              |
| **precise**  | exact, accurate                                        | We need a precise measurement to ensure system safety.     |
| **routing**  | determining path of network traffic                   | Routing decides how packets travel through a network.       |
| **compromise** | to weaken or expose (esp. security)                 | A leaked password compromises the whole system.             |

## ✍Reflection Essay  
> **“Security is no longer just code. It’s structure, psychology, and decision-making.”**

Despite reviewing CH1–5 multiple times, I still feel the concepts are slow to settle in my head.  
But I realized today: repetition doesn’t just rebuild memory — it **constructs frameworks**.

I was confused about symmetric/asymmetric keys, but using simple comparisons helped.  
Even more, words like “prey on” and “compromise” carry nuanced meanings in security contexts.  
These aren’t just definitions — they reflect how **attackers think**.

I’ll keep documenting every day. Progress isn't always obvious, but **structure builds clarity**.
