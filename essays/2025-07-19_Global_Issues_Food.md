## ✍️ Essay

Despite technological advances in food production, global hunger persists.  
Over 800 million people remain undernourished—not due to scarcity, but due to inequality.  
While agricultural output has kept pace with population growth, the degradation of arable land and climate change threaten long-term sustainability.  
Many nations still rely on outdated farming models, ignoring environmental costs.  
True development must be measured by its ability to reduce suffering—and that begins with rethinking how we grow, share, and protect our food.  

> **Ending hunger is not just about yield, but about justice, access, and ecological balance.**
