While some governments have attempted to promote population growth for strategic or economic reasons, such efforts rarely succeed without public alignment. Brazil and Argentina showed early interest in expansion, but lacked consistent action. Romania’s aggressive pro-birth policy under Ceausescu led to tragic consequences, including forced pregnancies and abandoned children.

In contrast, modern nations like Japan and Sweden rely on incentives—such as tax benefits and childcare support—but still face declining birth rates. These cases suggest that population growth cannot be engineered through policy alone. Cultural values, personal choice, and socio-economic conditions ultimately shape demographic trends more than state control ever could.
