## 5. Personal Reflection
While the incident underscores the adaptability of state-sponsored threat actors, it also reveals a structural weakness in the rapidly expanding global remote work economy. AI tools that empower legitimate workers can equally serve malicious actors, eroding trust in digital labor markets. Addressing this requires a combination of advanced detection technologies and international regulatory coordination, ensuring that economic opportunities are not exploited to finance activities that threaten global security.
