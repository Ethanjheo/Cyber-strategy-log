## 5. Personal Reflection

**English Commentary:**

While the hospital followed standard post-incident protocols—such as applying patches and conducting employee training—the response lacked advanced or differentiated defense strategies. In comparison, incidents like the 2019 AWS misconfiguration case saw responses involving FBI collaboration, architecture redesign announcements, and direct CEO press engagements.

Given that this was likely an IaaS-based environment, it placed more security responsibility on the user organization. This highlights a classic IaaS security failure, likely stemming from configuration weaknesses early in deployment. Modern protection should involve dynamic defense tools such as AI-driven anomaly detection and proactive incident simulations. Cybersecurity should not merely be reactive but must be embedded into the design and strategy from the start.
