## 5. Reflection  
The nature of cyberattacks is evolving with increasing sophistication and clarity over time. Notably, the healthcare sector has seen a rise in data breach incidents, a trend that may be partially attributed to its reliance on Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms. Compared to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models, IaaS frameworks often entail greater security burdens on end users, exposing more structural vulnerabilities.

Moreover, the behavior of threat actors appears to be shifting toward long-term strategic leverage rather than immediate financial gain. Instead of promptly disclosing or monetizing stolen data, attackers are increasingly retaining it as a bargaining tool—delaying disclosure in order to heighten pressure during negotiations.

In response, governments have begun proposing legal frameworks aimed at disincentivizing ransom payments in data hostage scenarios. However, legal deterrence alone may prove insufficient. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, often lack the financial capacity to implement robust cybersecurity infrastructures. As such, sustained institutional support and material incentives should be considered essential components of a broader policy approach to enhance security resilience across vulnerable sectors.
