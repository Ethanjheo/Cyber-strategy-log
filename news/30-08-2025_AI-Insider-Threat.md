## 2) Incident Summary
- Target: Organizations in Europe (survey base), with implications across multiple industries.
- Attacker: Insiders or compromised employees, increasingly augmented by generative AI.
- Impact:
  - 64% of European security professionals consider insider threats more dangerous than external attacks.
  - 53% of organizations experienced an increase in insider-related incidents over the past year.
  - Unauthorized generative AI usage reported in a majority of firms.
  - Only 44% of organizations have adopted User and Entity Behavioral Analytics (UEBA).
- Problem: Legacy perimeter defenses (IAM, DLP, EDR) fail to detect insiders using valid credentials combined with AI.
- Accountability: Shared responsibility among executives, boards (AI governance), and security teams (behavioral detection readiness).

## 3) Related Countries and Industries
- Country/Region: Europe (survey data), trend extending globally.
- Industries: Government, manufacturing, and healthcare sectors most at risk.
- Other academic perspectives:
  - Sociology: normalization of “shadow AI” within work practices.
  - Organizational studies: structural weaknesses in governance over emerging tech.
  - Political economy: unequal distribution of AI risk and oversight across industries.

## 4) Mitigations
- Response approach:
  - Establish insider risk programs integrating HR, Legal, and SecOps.
  - Deploy UEBA for behavioral anomaly detection with valid credentials.
  - Govern AI use: sanctioned platforms, clear internal policy, and monitoring for shadow AI.
- Related regulations:
  - GDPR (EU data protection).
  - NIS2 Directive (EU critical infrastructure risk management).
  - EU AI Act (phased enforcement beginning 2026).

## 5) My Take
This news highlights the importance of structural security frameworks. Insider threats should not be understood merely as the product of individual malicious intent, but rather as organizational issues arising from the structural use of AI introduced to enhance productivity.

Therefore, before relying on purely technical countermeasures, it is essential to identify recurring problem patterns in production processes. These are not simple technical vulnerabilities, but risks triggered by psychological and organizational factors that guide individual behavior.

Ultimately, instead of attempting to correct personal dispositions, a structural approach through governance and institutional mechanisms appears to be a far more effective strategy.
