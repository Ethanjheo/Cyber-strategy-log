## 4. Reflections
This incident is a textbook example of a failure to "shift security left."  
Social engineering occurred during the development phase, where a developer’s environment became the entry point.  
A seemingly minor human error exposed sensitive code, which the attacker escalated into a full compromise of the platform.  
Security should not be treated as a final step, but rather as a **continuous process** embedded across all stages — especially in development.  
Furthermore, clear accountability and responsibility structures must be in place to manage such risks effectively.
