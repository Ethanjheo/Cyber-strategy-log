## Personal Reflection

The movement of hackers seeking to obtain state-level intelligence is becoming increasingly active.  
Information has become a weapon — a strategic asset used to gain political and economic superiority.  
It is no longer just a reference; it is the foundation of dominance.

As such, cyberattacks will grow more calculated and sophisticated.  
In this evolving landscape, I realize the importance of studying not only network and system security but also physical security from a broader perspective.

> Information is power — and cybersecurity is the fortress that protects it.
