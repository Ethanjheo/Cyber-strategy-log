### 5. Personal Reflection

This incident underscores the strategic and operational risks posed by unsupported or poorly maintained legacy systems. From an organizational standpoint, the failure appears rooted in inadequate internal governance, particularly in the oversight of system lifecycle management and access control.

In contexts where highly sensitive personal data—such as biometric identifiers—is processed, continuous security assurance must be integrated into the operational fabric of the platform. Security cannot be treated as a static configuration but must evolve alongside user behavior and technological change.

To balance security with operational efficiency, organizations may adopt automated privilege expiration or disablement mechanisms for dormant user accounts and obsolete interfaces. Additionally, decoupling the user interface from backend functionality in legacy components can help reduce exposure without disrupting the user experience.

Overall, this case illustrates that maintaining digital trust in data-driven services requires proactive decommissioning strategies and the institutionalization of ongoing system audits.
