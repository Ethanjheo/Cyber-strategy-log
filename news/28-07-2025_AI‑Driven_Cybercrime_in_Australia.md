  - Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy 2023–2030

## 5. Personal Reflection

This case clearly illustrates that while AI brings substantial benefits to various industries, it simultaneously introduces proportional levels of risk. Despite its effectiveness in automation and anomaly detection, excessive reliance on AI technologies may create unforeseen vulnerabilities. 

In the context of cybersecurity, it is important to acknowledge that zero risk is unattainable. A secure-by-design approach—beginning with the “shift left” principle in Secure DevOps (SecDevOps)—should guide AI system development from the earliest stages. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of AI integration is likely to intensify regulatory scrutiny. Given the evolving landscape, a further expansion of compliance obligations can be cautiously anticipated.
